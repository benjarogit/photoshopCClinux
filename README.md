## ⚠️ Important Notice

### You Must Provide Photoshop Installation Files

**This repository does NOT include Photoshop installation files.**

You must:
1. **Own a valid Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 license**
2. **Obtain the installer yourself** (see [How to Get Photoshop](#how-to-get-photoshop-files))
3. **Place files in `photoshop/` directory** (see [photoshop/README.md](photoshop/README.md))

### ⚡ Version Compatibility

**This installer has been tested with Photoshop CC 2021 (v22.x).**

According to [Wine AppDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?iId=17&sClass=application) and community testing, different Photoshop versions have varying compatibility:

- ✅ **CC 2021 (v22.x)** - Tested and working (GPU disabled) - **Recommended**
- ✅ **CC 2019 (v20.x)** - Should work with similar setup
- ⚠️ **CC 2024** - Limited support, many GPU issues
- 🏆 **CS3-CS6** - Better Wine compatibility, but older features
- ❌ **CC 2020+** - Some versions have increased online requirements

**General Recommendation:**
Try installation with whatever Photoshop version you have access to. The installer is designed to work with various CC versions. If you encounter issues with your version, please report them in GitHub Issues!

**Why CC 2021 works well:**
- Good balance of modern features and Wine compatibility
- Works reliably with GPU disabled
- Offline installation possible
- Stable performance for professional work

**Alternative Versions:**
If you have access to older versions, **Photoshop CS6 (13.0)** or **CS3 (10.0)** have better Wine ratings (Silver/Platinum), but lack modern features.

### How to Get Photoshop Files

#### Option 1: Official Adobe (Recommended)
- Download from Adobe Creative Cloud
- Get offline installer for Photoshop CC 2019 (v20.x)

#### Option 2: Existing Installation
- If you have Photoshop on Windows, extract installation files
- Windows location: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2019\`

**⚖️ Legal:** You must have a valid license. This script only automates Wine installation.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjarogit/photoshopCClinux.git
cd photoshopCClinux
```

### 2. Place Photoshop Files

Copy your Photoshop CC 2019 installation files to `photoshop/` directory:

```
photoshop/

```

See [photoshop/README.md](photoshop/README.md) for detailed structure.

### 3. Run Pre-Check

```bash
chmod +x pre-check.sh
./pre-check.sh
```

Should show: ✅ "All critical checks passed!"

### 4. Disable Internet (Recommended)

```bash
# WiFi
nmcli radio wifi off

# Or Ethernet
sudo ip link set <interface> down
```

This prevents Adobe login prompts during installation.

## ⚙️ Command Line Options

The installer supports several command-line flags for automation and debugging:

- `--wine-standard`: Use Wine Standard (skip interactive Wine selection menu)
- `--quiet` / `-q`: Quiet mode - suppress all output except errors (useful for CI/testing)
- `--verbose` / `-v`: Verbose mode - show debug logs on console (useful for debugging)

### Examples

```bash
# Standard installation with Wine Standard (non-interactive)
./setup.sh --wine-standard

# Quiet installation (for CI/testing - only errors shown)
./setup.sh --quiet --wine-standard

# Verbose installation (for debugging - shows all debug logs)
./setup.sh --verbose --wine-standard

# Combine flags
./setup.sh --quiet --wine-standard
```

**Note:** All output is still logged to files even in quiet mode. Check `~/.photoshop/logs/` for detailed logs.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Photoshop Crashes on Startup

**Cause:** GPU acceleration incompatibility with Wine

**Solution:**
```
1. Launch Photoshop
2. Edit > Preferences > Performance (Ctrl+K)
3. Uncheck "Use Graphics Processor"
4. Uncheck "Use OpenCL"
5. Restart Photoshop
```

### Issue 2: "VCRUNTIME140.dll is missing"

**Cause:** Visual C++ Runtime not installed properly

**Solution:**
```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/.photoshop/prefix winetricks vcrun2015
```

### Issue 3: Liquify Tool Doesn't Work

**Cause:** GPU/OpenCL issues

**Solution:**
- Disable GPU acceleration (see Issue 1)
- Or disable OpenCL: Preferences > Performance > Uncheck "Use OpenCL"

### Issue 4: Blurry/Ugly Fonts

**Solution:**
```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/.photoshop/prefix winetricks fontsmooth=rgb
```

### Issue 5: Installation Hangs at 100%

**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- If nothing happens, close installer (Alt+F4)
- Installation is likely complete
- Verify: `ls ~/.photoshop/prefix/drive_c/Program\ Files/Adobe/`

### Issue 6: "ARKServiceAdmin" Error During Installation

**Solution:**
- This error can be **ignored**
- Click "Ignore" or "Continue"
- Installation will complete successfully

### Issue 7: Slow First Startup (1-2 Minutes)

**Not an Issue:**
- First startup is always slow
- Subsequent starts take 10-30 seconds
- This is normal Wine behavior

### Issue 8: Cannot Save as PNG

**Cause:** File format plugin issue in Wine

**Solution:**
```
1. File > Save As
2. Choose "PNG" from format dropdown
3. If it fails, try: File > Export > Export As > PNG
4. Alternative: Save as PSD, then use GIMP to export as PNG
```

### Issue 9: Screen Doesn't Update Immediately (Undo/Redo)

**Cause:** Wine rendering lag

**Solution:**
- This is a known Wine limitation
- Workaround: Force refresh with Ctrl+0 (fit to screen)
- Or: Enable virtual desktop in winecfg

### Issue 10: Zooming is Laggy

**Cause:** GPU acceleration disabled + Wine overhead

**Solution:**
```
1. Use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + / Ctrl -)
2. Zoom with mouse wheel is slower than native
3. This is expected behavior with Wine
4. Performance is better on wine-staging
```

### Issue 11: Adobe Installer "Next" Button Doesn't Respond

**Cause:** Adobe installer uses Internet Explorer engine (mshtml.dll) which doesn't work perfectly in Wine

**Solution:**
```
1. Install IE8 when prompted (takes 5-10 minutes, but significantly helps)
2. Wait 15-30 seconds - installer sometimes loads slowly
3. Use keyboard navigation:
   - Tab key multiple times to focus the button
   - Press Enter to click
   - Or: Alt+N (Next) / Alt+W (Weiter in German)
4. Click directly on the button (not beside it)
5. Bring installer window to foreground (Alt+Tab)
6. If nothing works: Try reinstalling Wine components with winetricks
```

**Note:** This is a known limitation of Wine with IE-based installers. The installer has already configured DLL-overrides and registry tweaks to improve compatibility.

## 🚀 Performance Tips

### Essential (For Stability)

1. **Disable GPU in Photoshop** (Ctrl+K → Performance)
2. **Disable OpenCL** (Ctrl+K → Performance)

### Optional (For Speed)

3. **Use Wine-Staging**
   ```bash
   # CachyOS/Arch
   sudo pacman -S wine-staging
   
   # Ubuntu
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cybermax-dexter/sdl2-backport
   sudo apt install wine-staging
   ```

4. **Enable CSMT**
   ```bash
   WINEPREFIX=~/.photoshop/prefix winetricks csmt
   ```

5. **Use Virtual Desktop** (if performance issues)
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh  # Option 5 → Graphics → Enable virtual desktop
   ```

### Expected Performance

| Feature | Native Windows | Wine Linux | Notes |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Basic Tools | 100% | 90-95% | Excellent |
| Filters | 100% | 80-90% | Good |
| Liquify | 100% | 70-80% | Usable (GPU off) |
| 3D Features | 100% | 30-50% | Limited |
| Camera Raw | 100% | 60-80% | Usable |
| Startup Time | 5-10s | 10-30s | After first launch |

**Overall:** 85-90% of native performance for standard photo editing.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

### Complete Removal

```bash
./setup.sh  # Select Option 6
```

When you select Option 6, you'll see a submenu:
- **Option 1**: Uninstall Photoshop (complete removal)
- **Option 2**: Force kill Photoshop processes (if Photoshop is stuck/hanging)
- **Option 3**: Back to main menu

**Option 1** removes:
- Wine prefix (`~/.photoshop/`)
- Desktop entry
- Terminal command (`/usr/local/bin/photoshop`)

**Option 2** forcefully terminates all Photoshop and Wine processes related to Photoshop. Use this if Photoshop is stuck or not responding.

### Manual Removal

```bash
# Remove installation
rm -rf ~/.photoshop/

# Remove desktop entry
rm ~/.local/share/applications/photoshop.desktop

# Remove command
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/photoshop
```
