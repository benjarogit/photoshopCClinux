# Release v2.1.0 - Experimental Proton GE Support & IE Engine Fixes

## 🧪 New Features

### Experimental: Proton GE Support
- **Proton GE Integration**: Optional support for [Proton GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) (community fork of Valve's Proton)
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects Proton GE from Steam directory or system installation
- **Interactive Selection**: Choose between Proton GE and Standard Wine during installation
- **Auto-Installation**: Option to automatically install Proton GE via AUR (Arch-based systems)
- **Better Compatibility**: Proton GE may provide better compatibility for some use cases

**⚠️ Experimental Status**: Proton GE support is currently experimental. Report issues in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/benjarogit/photoshopCClinux/issues).

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Adobe Installer "Next" Button Not Responding
- **Problem**: Adobe installer uses Internet Explorer engine (mshtml.dll) which doesn't work perfectly in Wine/Proton
- **Solution**: Comprehensive IE engine configuration
  - **IE8 Installation**: Optional IE8 installation (recommended, takes 5-10 minutes)
  - **DLL Overrides**: Set to `native,builtin` for maximum compatibility (was `builtin` only)
  - **Additional DLLs**: Added `actxprxy.dll`, `browseui.dll` overrides
  - **Registry Tweaks**: Disable script debugger, disable first-run customize
  - **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for keyboard navigation if buttons don't respond

### Proton GE Configuration Fix
- **Problem**: System-wide Proton GE was detected but not properly configured (PATH not set)
- **Fix**: Automatically finds Proton GE installation path and sets PATH correctly
- **Impact**: Proton GE is now actually used when selected, not just detected

### Menu Option Validation Fix
- **Problem**: Validation checked range (1-count) but options could be non-consecutive (e.g., [1,2,4])
- **Fix**: Validation now directly checks if selection exists in WINE_OPTIONS array
- **Impact**: Prevents "Selection not found" errors with non-consecutive option numbers

## 🔧 Improvements

### Installation Process
- **Better Logging**: More detailed logging of Wine/Proton version selection
- **Clearer Messages**: Explains which Wine version is used for installer vs Photoshop
- **IE8 Prompt**: Clear explanation why IE8 installation is recommended
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages if Proton GE installation fails

### Documentation
- **Proton GE Section**: Added experimental Proton GE support documentation
- **Button Issue**: Added Issue #11 for Adobe installer button problems
- **Community Help**: Encourages users to contribute and report issues
- **Known Limitations**: Documents Proton GE limitations (Steam auto-start, winetricks compatibility)

## 📝 Technical Details

### DLL Override Strategy
**Before:**
```bash
wine reg add ... /v mshtml /t REG_SZ /d builtin /f
```

**After (Best Practice):**
```bash
wine reg add ... /v mshtml /t REG_SZ /d "native,builtin" /f
# Tries native DLLs first, falls back to builtin
```

### Proton GE Detection
- **Steam Directory**: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton*`
- **System Installation**: `/usr/share/proton-ge`, `/usr/local/share/proton-ge`, or via `proton-ge` command
- **PATH Configuration**: Automatically sets PATH to Proton GE's wine binary

### Files Modified
- `scripts/PhotoshopSetup.sh` - Proton GE integration, IE engine fixes, menu validation
- `README.md` - Proton GE documentation, Issue #11
- `README.de.md` - Proton GE Dokumentation, Problem #11

# Release v2.0.9 - Critical Hotfix: RAM Detection & Math Correction

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

This hotfix release corrects two important issues discovered in v2.0.8 that affect RAM detection accuracy and completeness.

### Bug Fixes

#### 🔢 Fixed RAM Ceiling Division Formula
- **Problem:** Used incorrect rounding formula `(MB + 512) / 1024` which rounds to nearest, not up
- **Impact:** Systems with specific RAM amounts displayed incorrectly
  - Example: 1025 MB showed as 1 GB instead of 2 GB
  - Your system: 31995 MB now correctly shows 32 GB (was 31 GB)
- **Fix:** Proper ceiling division: `(MB + 1023) / 1024`
- **Math:** `ceiling(a/b) = (a + b - 1) / b`
- **Affected:** `setup.sh`, `pre-check.sh`, `troubleshoot.sh`

#### 🌍 Completed Locale Support in troubleshoot.sh
- **Problem:** `troubleshoot.sh` RAM detection missed `LC_ALL=C` prefix
- **Impact:** RAM detection failed on non-English systems (German, French, etc.)
- **Fix:** Added `LC_ALL=C` to `free -m` command
- **Now:** All three scripts (`setup.sh`, `pre-check.sh`, `troubleshoot.sh`) are fully locale-independent

### Technical Details

**Before (incorrect):**
```bash
# Rounds to nearest, not up
TOTAL_RAM=$(( (TOTAL_RAM_MB + 512) / 1024 ))

# Examples:
1025 MB → 1 GB  ❌ (should be 2 GB)
2049 MB → 2 GB  ❌ (should be 3 GB)
```

**After (correct):**
```bash
# Proper ceiling division
TOTAL_RAM=$(( (TOTAL_RAM_MB + 1023) / 1024 ))

# Examples:
1025 MB → 2 GB  ✅
2049 MB → 3 GB  ✅
```

### Files Modified
- `setup.sh` - RAM display in banner (line 298)
- `pre-check.sh` - RAM detection check (line 101)
- `troubleshoot.sh` - RAM detection check (lines 290-293)

### Why This Matters
- **Accuracy:** Users see correct RAM amounts
- **Consistency:** All scripts now use identical, mathematically correct formula
- **Completeness:** 100% locale support across all system detection scripts

# Release v2.0.8 - Universal Locale Support & Visual Polish

## 🌍 International Compatibility & UI Improvements

This release ensures the installer works flawlessly on **all Linux systems worldwide**, regardless of language settings, and adds final visual polish to the banner layout.

### What's New

#### 🌍 Universal Locale Support
- ✅ **RAM Detection Now Works Worldwide** - Fixed RAM detection on systems with non-English locales
  - Previously: Failed on German systems (showed "RAM konnte nicht ermittelt werden")
  - Now: Uses `LC_ALL=C` to force English output from system commands
  - Tested: German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, etc.
  - Impact: `free`, `df`, `du` commands now work on **all** locales

#### 🎨 Banner Visual Improvements
- ✅ **Symmetrical Logo Layout** - All 9 menu options now have consistent visual alignment
  - Empty logo line at top for balance
  - Options 1-8 aligned with logo details
  - Empty logo line between option 8 and 9 for symmetry
  - Option 9 (Exit) properly aligned with bottom logo line
  - Professional, balanced appearance

### Technical Details

**Locale-Independent System Commands:**
```bash
# OLD (locale-dependent):
free -m | awk '/^Mem:|^Speicher:/{print $2}'
df -BG "$HOME" | awk 'NR==2 {print $4}'

# NEW (universal):
LC_ALL=C free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $2}'
LC_ALL=C df -BG "$HOME" | awk 'NR==2 {print $4}'
```

**Why LC_ALL=C?**
- Forces English output on all systems
- Standard practice in professional shell scripts
- No hardcoded locale list needed
- Works on any Linux distribution worldwide

**Files Modified:**
- `setup.sh` - `get_system_info()` function (RAM detection)
- `pre-check.sh` - RAM, disk space, file size checks
- `troubleshoot.sh` - RAM detection, disk space check

**Locale Examples:**
- 🇩🇪 German: `Speicher:` / `Dateisystem` → `Mem:` / `Filesystem`
- 🇫🇷 French: `Mémoire:` → `Mem:`
- 🇪🇸 Spanish: `Memoria:` → `Mem:`
- 🇯🇵 Japanese: `メモリ:` → `Mem:`
- 🇨🇳 Chinese: `内存:` → `Mem:`

### Bug Fixes
- 🐛 **Fixed RAM Detection on German Systems** - No more "RAM konnte nicht ermittelt werden"
- 🐛 **Fixed Banner Visual Alignment** - All menu options now properly aligned with logo
- 🐛 **Fixed Disk Space Detection** - Now works on all language systems

---

# Release v2.0.7 - Internet Toggle Feature

## 🚀 New Feature: One-Click Internet Control

This release adds a convenient internet toggle option to the setup menu, making offline installation easier.

### What's New
- ✅ **Internet Toggle (Option 7)** - Turn WiFi on/off directly from the setup menu
  - Displays current status: "Internet: ON " or "Internet: OFF"
  - Uses `nmcli` to control WiFi radio
  - Perfect for ensuring offline installation (prevents Adobe login prompts)
  - Graceful fallback if `nmcli` is not available

### Why Disable Internet?
Adobe Creative Cloud installer tries to connect to Adobe servers during installation and may force a login. With **no internet**, the installer skips this check and installs offline without requiring an Adobe account.

### Menu Changes
- **Option 7:** Internet toggle (NEW)
- **Option 8:** Language switcher (moved from 7)
- **Option 9:** Exit (moved from 8)

# Release v2.0.6 - Critical Bug Fixes

## 🐛 Bug Fix Release: Script Exit Codes, Distro Name Truncation & Pre-Check Issues

This release fixes critical bugs discovered in v2.0.5 that could affect system detection, script error handling, and pre-installation checks.

### Bug Fixes
- 🐛 **Fixed `run_script()` Exit Code** - Script exit codes are now properly preserved when returning to the main directory
  - Previously: `cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"` would mask script failures with its own exit code (0)
  - Now: Exit code is captured before `cd` and explicitly returned to caller
  - Impact: Error detection now works correctly for all script calls
  
- 🐛 **Fixed Distro Name Truncation Logic** - Smart truncation now validates that truncation actually reduces length
  - Previously: Fallback truncation could expand short distro names (e.g., "Ubuntu" → "Ubunt..." is longer)
  - Now: Validates `(new_length + 3) < original_length` before truncating
  - Minimum 3 chars before "..." to ensure meaningful truncation
  - If distro is too short to truncate effectively, leave unchanged (padding handles overflow)
  - Impact: System info line never exceeds 74 characters, preserving display box formatting

- 🐛 **Fixed Pre-Check RAM Detection** - RAM is now correctly detected and displayed on all systems
  - Previously: Used `int($2/1024)` which returned 0 for systems with <1024MB RAM
  - Now: Uses same rounding logic as `setup.sh`: `(ram_mb + 512) / 1024`
  - Added validation check: `[ -n "$TOTAL_RAM" ] && [ "$TOTAL_RAM" -gt 0 ]` before comparisons
  - Impact: Fixes "Ganzzahl erwartet" error on line 257, RAM now shows correctly (e.g., 1GB)

- 🐛 **Fixed Pre-Check ANSI Colors** - Color codes are now properly displayed instead of showing raw escape sequences
  - Previously: `echo` commands didn't interpret ANSI codes like `\033[1;33m`
  - Now: Changed to `echo -e` for all lines containing color variables (`${YELLOW}`, `${BLUE}`, `${NC}`)
  - Impact: Recommendations and commands now display in color (yellow warnings, blue commands)

### Technical Details
- **setup.sh:**
  - `run_script()` now captures and returns script exit codes: `local exit_code=$?; return $exit_code`
  - Distro truncation validates `(new_distro_len + 3) < ${#distro}` to ensure truncation reduces length
  - Minimum 3-char distro name before "..." (e.g., "Arc..." for "Arch Linux")
  - If truncation would expand or not help, distro name is left unchanged
  - Padding automatically adjusts to fit within 74-char limit (negative padding → 0)

- **pre-check.sh:**
  - RAM calculation changed from `int($2/1024)` to `(ram_mb + 512) / 1024` (rounds up)
  - Added validation: `[ -n "$TOTAL_RAM" ] && [ "$TOTAL_RAM" -gt 0 ]` before all comparisons
  - Changed `echo` to `echo -e` for lines 147, 236, 240, 241, 251 (color code support)
